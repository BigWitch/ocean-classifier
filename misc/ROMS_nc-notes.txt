Notes on ROMS nc files for Montague subset

Dimensions
----------
165*116*30*30 = 17226000 data points
165*116 is lat and lon where 30 and 30 is depth and time 
Y axis = eta_Rho (lat) [116]
X axis = xi_rho (lon) [165]

Variables
----------
Seems the correct way to load lattitudes and logitudes for salinty and tempertaure is by "lon_rho" and "lat_rho"
