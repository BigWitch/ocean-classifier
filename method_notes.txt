Notes for methods:

target variables
predictor variables
binary classification


Notes:
Justify why use salinity and temperature as predictor variables (also time)

- correlation between variables? (salt/temp)
	- pearson correlation 

Need some validation trainng data (70-30)

Cross Validation
divde data into folds
